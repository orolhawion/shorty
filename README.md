# Shorty

Shorty is a tiny little URL shortener. It maps one URL to another. For persistence an H2 file based database is used. No frontend is provided here. 

# Features
Right now Shorty is pretty simple. You can 
* create mappings using the PUT endpoint
* retrieve mappings using the GET endpoint

For more details please see openapi.yaml.

However, the feature list may grow over time.

# Future
* Security considerations
* A lifetime feature for mappings
* URL representations (e. g. QR codes)
